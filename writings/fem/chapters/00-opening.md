# Part IV — The Finite Element Method

Part III reduced field equations on domains to weak forms: bilinear forms on Sobolev spaces, loads as dual functionals, energy functionals with unique minimizers. Part IV asks the engineer's question: *how do we compute those solutions on a mesh?*

The finite element method is the answer for elliptic and parabolic problems on complex geometries — the copper wire in tension, a bracket with a reentrant corner, a heated solid coupled to a fluid boundary. We begin with **weighted residuals**, the family of methods that includes Galerkin's method as its most important member, then build element-by-element assembly, quadrature, and convergence theory that connects discrete stiffness matrices to the infinite-dimensional operators of Part II.

The layout follows the **FEM Notes** in [`writings/fem/`](../../writings/fem/): five numbered chapters from residuals through error estimates, with **Bridge** sections linking each chapter to the next. Part V offers the complementary philosophy for fluids and hyperbolic conservation laws; both discretizations approximate the PDEs defined here.

## Where we left the wire

Part III wrote the weak forms — virtual work for elasticity, the heat equation in \(H^1\), energy functionals with unique minimizers — and identified the Sobolev regularity FEM solutions possess. The copper wire is now ready for a **mesh**: tetrahedra or hexahedra along its length, shape functions on each element, quadrature rules that assemble local stiffness into a global \(\mathbf{K}\).

At this scale the wire is a solid specimen in a tensile test: displacement unknowns at nodes, boundary conditions at the grips, perhaps a refined region near a stress concentrator. Part IV is the engineer's answer to Part III's mathematics — how weighted residuals become Galerkin assembly, how convergence rates connect discrete matrices to the infinite-dimensional operators of Part II, and why the stiffness matrix is not magic but a best approximation in energy norm.

## The concept map

| Question | Example in this part |
|----------|----------------------|
| What **object** are we studying? | Trial space \(V_h\), shape functions, assembled \(\mathbf{K}\) and \(\mathbf{f}\) |
| What **structure** does it add? | Galerkin orthogonality, isoparametric maps, \(h\)-refinement |
| What **theorem** becomes possible? | Best approximation, Céa lemma, a priori convergence rates |
| What **breaks** if structure is missing? | Locking, hourglass modes, pollution on distorted elements |

**Baby picture:** choose trial and test spaces, enforce the weak form by making residuals orthogonal to the test space, assemble element by element, then prove the discrete solution tracks the continuous one as \(h \to 0\). The copper wire in tension is a bar whose stiffness matrix is not magic — it is a Galerkin projection.

## Bridge

Part III ended with energy methods and the promise of assembly. The first chapter below introduces weighted residuals — the unifying idea behind Galerkin's method — and shows why choosing test functions as trial functions is the natural discretization of the weak form the copper wire's equilibrium demands.
